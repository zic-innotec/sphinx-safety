:octicon:`beaker` Usage
=======================

This documentation supports two types of data contributions:

* **Open and freely accessible content**: Related to Open-Source
  projects and publicly available tools.
* **Closed and internal content**: Related to in-house tools and
  workflows.

The examples and explanations in this documentation focus on the first
use case. Specific requirements for secured, internal data
contributions are described later.

Add Data
--------

Use Cases
+++++++++

Use cases are the starting point for both Classification and
Qualification. They describe the tasks to be performed and the
expected results. Use cases are linked to specific tool features that
help achieve the desired outcome.

The most critical aspect of a use case is its Tool Impact (``ti``)
level: - **TI = 2**: Indicates a safety-relevant impact on the final
product. - **TI = 1**: Indicates no safety relevance.

Only use cases with a TI level of **2** require further examination.

Use cases are stored in the ``/use_cases`` folder.

**Example**

.. code-block:: rst

   .. usecase:: Document SW architecture    <- Title
      :id: UC_SW_ARCH                       <- Unique ID
      :inputs:                              <- Needed input artifacts
      :outputs:                             <- Result artifacts
      :tools: TOOL_SPHINX, TOOL_SN          <- List of used tools
      :features: FE_SPINX_ARCH              <- List of used features
      :ti: 2                                <- Tool impact level

      Create documentation to document and track software architecture.

      The documentation is used as part of an official release delivery.

Features & Errors
+++++++++++++++++

A feature describes a specific functionality of a tool. During its
execution, certain errors may occur, which are documented as sub-needs
within the feature.

An important attribute of both features and errors is the Tool Error
Detection level (``TD``), which indicates how well an error can be
detected: - **TD = 1**: The error is detected, and execution stops
without producing a final result. - **TD = 2**: The error is reported,
but execution continues. - **TD = 3**: The error occurs silently
without detection.

The feature's ``TD`` value is determined by the "worst" TD level of
all its related errors.

Features are stored in tool-specific folders, such as ``/tools/sphinx/``.

**Example**

.. code-block:: rst

   .. feature:: Read Traceability objects          <- Feature title
      :id: FE_SN_READ                              <- Unique ID
      :tools: TOOL_SN                              <- Tool link
      :td:                                         <- Combined Tool Error Detection level

      Read Traceability objects from rst/md files
      into the internal storage.

      .. error:: Syntax errors in rst/md files     <- A first error with title
         :id: ER_SN_SYN_ER                         <- Unique ID
         :td: 1                                    <- Tool Error Detection level

      .. error:: Missing external needs.json file  <- A second error with title
         :id: ER_SN_JSON_NOT_FOUND                 <- Unique ID
         :td: 3                                    <- Tool Error Detection level

.. hint:: The ``td`` option is only available in the Qualification package.

Restrictions
++++++++++++

Restrictions define ways to avoid specific errors, such as by not
using certain functions or configurations. They are linked to one or
more errors.

During tool execution, compliance with restrictions should be checked
automatically or through a manual process.

**Example**

.. code-block:: rst

   .. restriction:: Do not use dynamic functions      <- Title
      :id: CHECK_SN_NO_DYN                            <- Unique ID
      :avoids: ER_SN_DYN_INVALID, ER_SN_DYN_WRONG     <- Links to errors

      Dynamic functions can execute unqualified code,
      which has full access to all Sphinx-Needs data.
      This can corrupt the data.

Checks
++++++

Checks are responsible for the following tasks:

* Verifying if an error has occurred.
* Ensuring that a restriction has been followed.

Like restrictions, checks are linked to errors and are often
implemented as additional scripts executed during tool execution in a
CI system.

.. hint::

   Checks are defined in the :ref:`qualification` section and are not
   part of this Classification documentation.

Test Cases
++++++++++

.. hint::

   Test cases are documented in the :ref:`qualification` section and are
   not part of this Classification documentation.

Internal Documentation
----------------------

In many cases, the toolchain is a mix of Open Source, commercial, and
internal tools. As a result, the Classification and Qualification
process must align with the access policies of these tools.

This documentation focuses on publicly available tools. Internal tools
should be documented in a separate internal project stored in private
repositories.

The documentation concept used here can be copied or extended to
create internal documentation projects.

Create Your Own Internal Project
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using **Sphinx** and its ``sphinx-quickstart`` command, you can
quickly create a Sphinx-based documentation project.

**Requirements**

* ``rye`` installed.

**Steps**

1. Create a new folder and navigate to it::

     mkdir new_project
     cd new_project
#. Initialize the project with ``rye``::

     rye init
#. Add Sphinx as a dependency::

     rye add sphinx
#. Run the Sphinx quickstart command and follow the prompts::

     rye run sphinx-quickstart
#. Open the project in an IDE, such as VS Code::

     code .
#. Use this documentation's configuration as a baseline. Copy the
   following files:

   - ``conf.py`` from https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-safety/blob/main/conf.py
   - ``pyproject.toml`` from https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-safety/blob/main/pyproject.toml
   - ``ubproject.toml`` from https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-safety/blob/main/ubproject.toml

#. Update the copied files with project-specific values, such as ``name``
   and ``description``.
#. Sync dependencies::

     rye sync
#. Build the documentation::

     rye run sphinx-build -b html . _build/html/
#. Open the generated documentation in a browser::

     _build/html/index.html
#. Done!

Reuse This Documentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are several ways to reuse parts of this documentation:

* Use :external+needs:doc:`Imported needs <directives/needimport>` to
  import Sphinx-Needs objects from this documentation.
* Use :external+needs:ref:`External needs <needs_external_needs>` to
  create links to objects from this documentation.
* Use the ``include`` directive to import reStructuredText (rst) code
  from this documentation.
* Use symbolic links (symlinks) to reference files at the file system
  level.

.. image:: /_static/need_integration.drawio.png
   :align: center

For the last two options, integrating this repository as a `git submodule <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`__
is recommended. If you use a submodule, ensure that the submodule
folder is added to the ``exclude_patterns`` configuration option in
the ``conf.py`` file to prevent this documentation from being built
unintentionally.

Include Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following image illustrates the connection between files in this
Classification project and files in a separately created project.

.. image:: /_static/integration_include.drawio.png
   :align: center

The Classification files are made locally available using the **git
submodule** mechanism. The newly created project is stored in parallel
to the Classification project.

This setup allows the use of the **include** directive. For example,
to include the file ``own-docs/tools/sphinx/features.rst``, use the
following:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. include:: /../sphinx/classification/tools/sphinx/features.rst

.. hint::

   It is recommended to copy the folder and file structure of the Sphinx
   Classification documentation. This ensures that all links and
   references work without requiring modifications.

The ``.. include::`` directive copies the entire content of the
specified file into the "extended" version. This includes headlines,
image directives, and other content.

.. figure:: /_static/include_way_of_working.drawio.png
   :align: center

   The ``include`` way of working.

This integration method is also used for the :ref:`qualification`.
This means that an integrated or linked Classification documentation
can easily be replaced by a link to the Qualification documentation.
Both projects follow the same folder and file structure, ensuring
seamless integration.
