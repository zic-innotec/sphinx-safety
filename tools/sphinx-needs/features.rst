      :id: ER_SN_DYN_INVALID

   .. error:: Dynamic functions return wrong meta-data
      :id: ER_SN_DYN_WRONG

      Internal dynamic functions are checked by test-cases in Sphinx-Needs
      itself.

      But self-written dynamic functions can do whatever they want, as long
      as the returned data ist still valid (but may be wrong).

      So self-written dynamic functions need test cases as well!

   .. error:: Sphinx-Needs data not valid

   .. error:: Back-links are not set
      :id: ER_SN_LINKS_NO_BACK

      Links are set only in one direction but not in the other.

      This may lead to missing information, e.g. a Traceability object is
      linked to a specification, but you can't find the linked Traceability
      object during specification implementation.

      and incorrect documentation.

   .. error:: Link target is not valid
      :id: ER_SN_LINK_TARGET_NOT_VALID
      

      If a link target is not valid, it may lead to errors in the
      documentation or incorrect traceability.

.. feature:: Bidirectional link tracking
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_LINKING_BIDIRECTIONAL
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   When you link from need A to need B, Sphinx-Needs automatically knows
   about the incoming link on need B. This allows for full, bidirectional
   traceability without extra work.

.. feature:: Dead link detection and warnings
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_LINKING_DEAD_LINK_DETECTION
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   The Sphinx build will issue a warning if a need links to an ID that
   does not exist. This helps to maintain the integrity of the
   traceability data.

   .. error:: Dead link not detected
      :id: ER_SN_DEAD_LINK_NOT_DETECTED
      

      If a dead link is not detected, it may lead to missing traceability
      and incorrect documentation.

   .. error:: Dead link false positive
      :id: ER_SN_DEAD_LINK_FALSE_POSITIVE
      

      If a dead link is falsely reported, it may lead to unnecessary warnings
      and confusion in the documentation.

Automated Features
++++++++++++++++++

.. feature:: Constraint checking to validate need relationships
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_DYNAMIC_CONSTRAINTS
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Define rules, or constraints, about your need data that are checked
   during the build. For example, you can enforce that every requirement
   must be linked to a test case.

   .. code-block:: python

      # In conf.py
      needs_constraints = {
          "req_verified": {
              "check_code": "len(links_back['verifies']) > 0",
              "severity": "error",
              "filter": "'req' in tags"
          }
      }

   .. error:: Constraint not checked during build
      :id: ER_SN_CONSTRAINT_NOT_CHECKED

      If a constraint is not checked during the build, it may lead to
      missing or incorrect traceability data.

   .. error:: Constraint check fails silently
      :id: ER_SN_CONSTRAINT_FAIL_SILENTLY

      If a constraint check fails silently, it may lead to missing or
      incorrect traceability data without any error message.

   .. error:: Constraint check runs with wrong data
      :id: ER_SN_CONSTRAINT_WRONG_DATA

      If a constraint check runs with wrong data, it may lead to incorrect
      traceability data and errors in the documentation.

   .. error:: Constraint check runs with incomplete data
      :id: ER_SN_CONSTRAINT_INCOMPLETE_DATA
      

      If a constraint check runs with incomplete data, it may lead to
      missing or incorrect traceability data and errors in the documentation.

   .. error:: Constraint check runs with invalid data

   :si: yes

   Export all need objects and their relationships into a structured ``needs.json``
   file. This file can be used for external analysis, reporting, or
   imported into other Sphinx projects.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sphinx-build -b needs . _build

   .. error:: Exporting needs.json fails silently
      :id: ER_SN_EXPORT_JSON_FAIL_SILENTLY

      If the export fails silently, it may lead to missing or incomplete data
      in the project without any error message.

   .. error:: Exported needs.json file is not valid
      :id: ER_SN_EXPORT_JSON_NOT_VALID

      If the exported needs.json file is not valid, it may lead to errors in
      the documentation or incorrect traceability. 

   .. error:: Exported needs.json file is corrupted
      :id: ER_SN_EXPORT_JSON_CORRUPTED

      If the exported needs.json file is corrupted, it may lead to errors in
      the documentation or incorrect traceability.

.. feature:: Permalink generation to specific need objects
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_EXPORT_PERMALINKS
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Generate a ``needs.json`` file where each need includes a permalink to
   its location in the HTML documentation. This is useful for linking
   from external tools directly to the requirement definition.

   .. error:: Permalink generation fails silently
      :id: ER_SN_PERMALINK_FAIL_SILENTLY
      

      If the permalink generation fails silently, it may lead to missing or
      incomplete data in the project without any error message.

   .. error:: Permalink is not valid
      :id: ER_SN_PERMALINK_NOT_VALID

      If the permalink is not valid, it may lead to errors in the
      documentation or incorrect traceability.

   .. error:: Permalink links to non-existing need
      :id: ER_SN_PERMALINK_NON_EXISTING

      If the permalink links to a non-existing need, it may lead to errors in
      the documentation or incorrect traceability.

   .. error:: Permalink links to wrong need
      :id: ER_SN_PERMALINK_WRONG_NEED

      If the permalink links to the wrong need, it may lead to errors in the
      documentation or incorrect traceability.
