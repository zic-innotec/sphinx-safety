.. feature:: Display Traceability objects content in Sphinx-Needs
   :id: FE_SN_CONTENT_RENDER
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   .. error:: Content contains syntax errors
      :id: ER_SN_CONTENT_SYNTAX

.. feature:: Assign meta-data to Traceability objects in Sphinx-Needs
   :id: FE_SN_SET_META
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   .. error:: Dynamic functions return invalid meta-data
      :id: ER_SN_DYN_INVALID

   .. error:: Dynamic functions return wrong meta-data
      :id: ER_SN_DYN_WRONG

      Internal dynamic functions are checked by test-cases in Sphinx-Needs
      itself.

      But self-written dynamic functions can do whatever they want, as long
      as the returned data ist still valid (but may be wrong).

      So self-written dynamic functions need test cases as well!

   .. error:: Sphinx-Needs data not valid
      :id: ER_SN_META_INVALID

   .. error:: Sphinx-Needs data is not process-compliant
      :id: ER_SN_META_NOT_COMPLIANT

   :id: FE_SN_LINK
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   .. error:: Back-links are not set
      :id: ER_SN_LINKS_NO_BACK

      Links are set only in one direction but not in the other.

      This may lead to missing information, e.g. a Traceability object is
      linked to a specification, but you can't find the linked Traceability
      object during specification implementation.

   .. error:: Internal target link is not found
      :id: ER_SN_LINKS_NO_TARGET

      documentation.

      Sphinx-Needs shows a warning for all not found used need-IDs for
      links.

.. feature:: Generate object representation in Sphinx-Needs
   :id: FE_SN_DOCTREE
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   .. error:: Meta-data missing
      :id: ER_SN_LAY_META_MIS

      Needed meta-data is not part of the final representation in the
      doctree and so later HTML/PDF build

   .. error:: Wrong meta-data is used
      :id: ER_SN_LAY_META_WRONG

      Sphinx-Needs is adding wrong Meta-Data to the final doctree-layout

.. feature:: Export needs.json file using Sphinx-Needs

   :si: yes

   Allows the definition of custom need types beyond the built-in ones.
   Each type gets its own directive, title, and color for easy
   identification in diagrams.

   .. code-block:: python

      # In conf.py
      needs_types = [
          dict(directive="req", title="Requirement", prefix="R_", color="#BFD8D2"),

          {
              "option": "verifies",
              "incoming": "verified by",
              "outgoing": "verifies",
          },
          {
              "option": "implements",
              "incoming": "implemented by",
              "outgoing": "implements",
          }
      ]

.. feature:: Automatic ID generation
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_AUTO_ID
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Sphinx-Needs can automatically generate a unique ID for any need that
   does not have one. The format of the ID can be configured using a
   prefix and a specific length.

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. req:: This requirement will get an ID automatically.
         :tags: auto_id

.. feature:: Manual ID assignment
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_MANUAL_ID
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   useful for referencing important requirements easily.

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. req:: A requirement with a specific ID
         :id: R_IMPORTANT_FEATURE

.. feature:: Need status enforcement
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_STATUS_ENFORCEMENT
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   You can define a list of allowed statuses for needs. If a need uses a
   status that is not on the list, Sphinx will raise a warning during the
   build.

   .. code-block:: python

      # In conf.py
      needs_statuses = [
          ('open', 'Is still open'),
          ('in_progress', 'Work in progress'),
          ('closed', 'Is closed'),
          ('rejected', 'Will not be implemented'),
      ]

.. feature:: Tagging support
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_TAGGING
   :tools: TOOL_SN

.. feature:: Unique ID enforcement and checks
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_UNIQUE_ID_ENFORCEMENT
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Sphinx-Needs automatically checks if all manually set IDs are unique
   across the project. The build will fail if a duplicate ID is found,
   ensuring data consistency.

   change the status, or set any other option for all filtered needs.

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. needextend:: status == 'in_progress'
         :add_tags: sprint_5

Linking and Traceability
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. feature:: Direct linking between needs using IDs
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_LINKING_DIRECT
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Create links between needs by referencing their unique IDs in link
   options. This forms the basis of all traceability in Sphinx-Needs.

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. spec:: Defines how the login button works.
         :id: S_LOGIN_BUTTON

      .. req:: The login button must be blue.
         :id: R_LOGIN_COLOR
         :links: S_LOGIN_BUTTON

.. feature:: Bidirectional link tracking
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_LINKING_BIDIRECTIONAL
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   When you link from need A to need B, Sphinx-Needs automatically knows
   about the incoming link on need B. This allows for full, bidirectional
   traceability without extra work.

.. feature:: Dead link detection and warnings
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_LINKING_DEAD_LINK_DETECTION
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   The Sphinx build will issue a warning if a need links to an ID that
   does not exist. This helps to maintain the integrity of the
   traceability data.

Automated Features
++++++++++++++++++

.. feature:: Constraint checking to validate need relationships
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_DYNAMIC_CONSTRAINTS
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Define rules, or constraints, about your need data that are checked
   during the build. For example, you can enforce that every requirement
   must be linked to a test case.

   .. code-block:: python

      # In conf.py
      needs_constraints = {
          "req_verified": {
              "check_code": "len(links_back['verifies']) > 0",
              "severity": "error",
              "filter": "'req' in tags"
          }
      }

Configuration & Customization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. feature:: Configuration via conf.py or an external TOML file
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_CONFIG_FILES
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: no

   All Sphinx-Needs options can be configured in the main ``conf.py`` file.
   For large configurations, you can also use an external ``needs.toml``
   file to keep things organized.

.. feature:: Customizable layouts for need presentation
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_CONFIG_LAYOUTS
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Change the visual presentation of needs by defining custom layouts.
   You can reorder options, use grids, and change how information is
   displayed.

   .. code-block:: python

      # In conf.py
      needs_layouts = {
          'my_layout': {
              'grid': 'simple_side_right',
              'layout': {
                  'side': ['id', 'status', 'tags', 'links']
              }
          }
      }

Exporting & Reporting
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. feature:: JSON builder to export all need data
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_EXPORT_JSON
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Export all need objects and their relationships into a structured ``needs.json``
   file. This file can be used for external analysis, reporting, or
   imported into other Sphinx projects.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sphinx-build -b needs . _build

.. feature:: Permalink generation to specific need objects
   :id: FE_SPHINX_NEEDS_EXPORT_PERMALINKS
   :tools: TOOL_SN
   :si: yes

   Generate a ``needs.json`` file where each need includes a permalink to
   its location in the HTML documentation. This is useful for linking
   from external tools directly to the requirement definition.
