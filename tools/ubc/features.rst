      This can have several reasons:

      * Not supported or unknown Sphinx-Needs directives. Like

        * list2needs

      * Not supported features of Sphinx-Needs. Like

        * dynamic functions

      * Unknown script executions
      * Unknown/not accessible sources, like

        * external services
        * import of needs.json files
        * unknown rst files

.. feature:: Validate needs.json
   :id: FE_UBC_VALIDATE_JSON
   :tools: TOOL_UBC
   :inputs: ART_UBC_NEEDS_JSON
   :si: no

   .. error:: Unknown file format
      :id: ER_UBC_VAL_FORMAT

   .. error:: Incomplete Validation
      :id: ER_UBC_VAL_INCOMPLETE

      Not all types and options, which are represetned in a given needs.json
      file, are known/defined by the ``ubproject.toml`` configuration.
