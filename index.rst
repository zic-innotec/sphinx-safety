               Qualification Support

This documentation provides the necessary information to achieve
"qualification readiness" for any Sphinx-based project. It includes ``use cases``,
``features``, ``errors``, and ``restrictions`` represented as `Sphinx-Needs <https://sphinx-needs.com>`__
objects.

The classification serves as the foundation for any qualification
process. Additional qualification support is available through a
commercial :ref:`qualification` provided by `useblocks <https://useblocks.com>`__
and `Innotec <https://innotecsafety.com/>`__.

   **Project Status**

   This documentation is in its early stages. Tools and data are
   currently being collected and classified. Contributions are welcome!

   to join as a user or contributor.

   The current status and problemeatic entries can seen in
   :ref:`analysis` and :ref:`completeness`.

Supported Standards
-------------------

This documentation provides essential information for the
classification of Sphinx and Sphinx-Needs according to the following
standards:

* **Automotive**: `ISO 26262 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262>`__
* **Automation, Industrial**: `IEC 61508 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61508>`__
* **Railway**: `EN 50716 <https://www.dinmedia.de/de/norm/din-en-50716/378381071>`__
* **Medical**: `IEC 62304 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62304>`__
* **Agriculture**: `ISO 25119 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_25119>`__
* Additional standards can be added upon request or via a pull request.

Tool Scope
----------

The classification and qualification documentation cover the following
tools:

.. needtable::
   :filter: type == "tool"
   :style: table
   :columns: title, id, version, status
   :colwidths: 30,30,20,20

Please note that this classification does not cover **all features**
of a tool. It focuses exclusively on safety-relevant use cases. As a
result, a Tool Confidence Level (TCL) is assigned to individual use
cases rather than the tool as a whole.

Use Case Scope
--------------

.. needtable::
   :filter: type == "usecase"
   :style: table
   :columns: id, title, ti as "TI", tcl as "TCL"
   :colwidths: 20,40,20,20
